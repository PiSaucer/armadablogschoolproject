title: Judging a book by its cover
---

Everyone says not to judge a book by its cover; however, Everyone subconsciously judges.

After doing much-needed research to find a book to read for the 4th quarter independent reading, I decided to read Armada by Ernest Cline.

I have started one of his other books, Ready Player One; however, I never finished it. Some of the previous books that I read semi-enjoyed are mostly sci-fi books like A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams.

It was also hard to find a book at the High School Junior reading level. The Lexile score of Armada is 1110L, which is 11th grade.

Amazon describes the book as: 

```md
Zack Lightman has never much cared for reality. He vastly prefers the countless science-fiction movies, books, and videogames he's spent his life-consuming. And too often, he catches himself wishing that some fantastic, impossible, world-altering event could arrive to whisk him off on a grand spacefaring adventure. 

So when he sees the flying saucer, he's sure his years of escapism have finally tipped over into madness. 

Especially because the alien ship he's staring at is straight out of his favorite videogame, a flight simulator called Armadaâ€”in which gamers just happen to be protecting Earth from alien invaders. 

As impossible as it seems, what Zack's seeing is all too real. And it's just the first in a blur of revelations that will force him to question everything he thought he knew about Earth's history, its future, even his own life--and to play the hero for real, with humanity's life in the balance. 

But even though the terror and exhilaration, he can't help thinking: Doesn't something about this scenario feel a little bit like ... well ... fiction? 

At once reinventing and paying homage to science-fiction classics, Armada is a rollicking, surprising thriller, a coming-of-age adventure, and an alien invasion tale like nothing you've ever read before.
