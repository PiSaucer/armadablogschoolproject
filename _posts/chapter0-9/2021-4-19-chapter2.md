title: The PHAËTON Journal - Chapter 2
comments: false

Is it just wild theories or the truth?

When Zach comes home he goes through his father's old stuff. His father's name was Xavier Ulysses Lightman. His mom kept all of his father's belongings in cardboard boxes in the attic. It includes a collection of old video games, VCR, VHS tapes, old clothes, old cards and letters, and old role-playing game materials.

Mixed in the role-playing game was a particular notebook with the title, PHAËTON. It contained a global conspiracy that Zach's father believed in. It involved top-secret projects involving video games and the US Military. In the front of the book, it had a timeline it's posted below. It seems like Star Wars was the main focal point for the timeline.

He then goes in detail of the fictional name POLYBIUS. It was an urban legend that had been debunked many times. Its origin takes place in Malibu Grand Prix, which is the local arcade in his town. It's an actual urban legend and is not just made up for the story. His father's notes were:

```txt
- No copyright or manufacturer info anywhere on game cabinet.
- Reportedly only seen for 1–2 weeks in July 1981 at MGP.
- Gameplay was similar to Tempest. Vector graphics. Ten levels?
- Higher levels caused players to have seizures, hallucinations, and nightmares. In some cases, subject committed murder and/or suicide.
- “Men in Black” would download scores from the game each night.
- Possible early military prototype created to train gamers for war?
- Created by same covert op behind Bradley Trainer?
``` 

His father then believes that he saw PHAËTON. It similar to POLYBIUS. An arcade machine that only existed for a day. It had a cockpit-like interior completed with all the switches that an plane would have. His father's notes were:

```txt
- Only seen at MGP on 8-9-1989 — removed and never seen again.
- No copyright or manufacturer information anywhere. Plain black game cabinet — just like the eyewitness descriptions of Polybius.
- First-person space combat simulator — gameplay similar to Battlezone and Tail Gunner 2. Color vector graphics.
- “Men in Black” arrived at closing time and took game away in a black cargo van — also very similar to Polybius stories.
- Link between Bradley Trainer and Polybius and Phaëton? All prototypes created to train/test gamers for military recruitment?
