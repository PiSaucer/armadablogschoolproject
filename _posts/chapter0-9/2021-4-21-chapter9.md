"Real girls are never perfect and perfect girls are never girl" - Anonymous

Zach gets into a elevator with fifteen other people. Then procedes to walk into a IMAX size theather filled with people. They are from all different walks of life. Some wore normal clothes, winter coats, summer wear, business suits, fast food uniforms, surgical scrubs, etc. One person was even in their wedding dress. Everyone was drastically different in age, gender, and ethnicity. 

Zach scans the room finding a place to seat. He see a girl who dresses in a goth-ish style. Black combat boots, black jeans, and black tank top. Her hair was half shaved. She had muscle tattoes. When Zach spotted her she was drinking from a R2-D2 flask. As he approaches he notice that she took apart and reassemble the QComm to try to bypass the restictions. 

After flitting with her, he learns that her name is Alexis Larkin. She is from Texas and is in the Thirty Dozen in Terra Firma. Zach gave her his father's jacket since she was cold.
