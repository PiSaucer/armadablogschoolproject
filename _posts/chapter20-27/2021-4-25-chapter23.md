title: The Council's Fate - Chapter 23
---

"Peace is not made at the council table or by treaties, but in the hearts of men." - Herbert Hoover

Zach's QComm ringed while he was awaiting a response from the Council. He added his father to the group call. 

The Council agrees with the General's theory. They also included information about Envoy Probe. Nixon orders Nasa to nuke them first before they can nuke us. This proves that we started the war. The whole time it was us and not them. It's too late to convince EDA to change course. They also didn't have any access to its leader, Admiral Viper.

Then everyone in the Council was kicked from the calls and their QComms locked. Admiral Viper joined the call. Zach and his father both announce they are done fighting for this cause. Zach's father tried to explain that they are giving humanity a second chance, to re-think this, and to reconsider. Admiral Viper refuses and left the call.

The backup plan was the stop the Icebreaker themselves. Lex, Whoadie, and Debbie all joined the call. They all agree to help. Diehl and Cruz also want to be part of it too.
