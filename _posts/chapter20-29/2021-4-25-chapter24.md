"To be prepared is half the victory." - Miguel De Cervantes

The part of the Squad in Beaverton met at Starbase Ace. Zach introduced his friends to his father. When they enter the store, Zach's father lit up when he saw the flight controller for sale.

Zach called Ray and explained everything. He proceeds to tell Zach where the hardwire EDA internet is so they can hook up the Battlestations. 

They came up with a plan, and it unknown to the reader. Zach's father climbs in Zach's damaged Interceptor and sets course for Raven Rock Command Center. That is where Admiral Viper is currently station.
